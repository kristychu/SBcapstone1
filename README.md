# ACNH Fish Tracker
## Description
Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) is a Nintendo switch game where you can catch and discover different types of critters (Fish, Bugs, and Sea Creatures) and Fossils. ACNH Fish Tracker allows users to keep track of which fish users have already caught and which fish users still need to catch.

## Features

- Save fish as Caught or Uncaught
- See a fish's catchphrase when you save it as "Caught"
- Future Features:
	- Show additional information on each fish (seasonality, price, etc.)
	- Filter the fish by name, seasonality, price
	- Provide the same features for Bugs, Sea Creatures, and Fossils
	- Share your Caught/Uncaught inventory with others

## User Flow
